    <h2>Community Manifesto</h2>

    <p>
        To quote Stan Garfield’s definition:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Communities are groups of people who, for a specific subject, share a specialty, interest, concern, or a set of problems.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Community members deepen their understanding of the subject by interacting on an ongoing basis, asking and answering questions, sharing information, reusing good ideas, solving problems for one another, and developing new and better ways of doing things.
    </p>

    <p>
        At T4S, we take that one step further by asserting the following:
    </p>

    <p>
        We Value
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Integrity & Honesty</li>
        <li>Sharing & Empathy</li>
        <li>Team work & Leadership by Example</li>
        <li>Initiative & Follow through</li>
        <li>Creativity & Experimentation</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We believe:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>In the basic equality of people</li>
        <li>Learning comes through doing</li>
        <li>Ideas need market validation early and often</li>
        <li>Value and profit is generated through free markets, customer understanding, and the power of well-executed ideas</li>
        <li>Anything worth doing, is worth doing well</li>

    </ol>

    <p>
        As a community member, I assert the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>I will give before I ask.</li>
        <li>I realize that many team members are working part time, and below competitive market rates out of a sense of collaboration, and will treat their time with respect.</li>
        <li>I accept my team members’ strengths and weaknesses, but will support and challenge them and myself to learn, grow and succeed.</li>
        <li>Where possible, I will offer autonomy to my team members in the execution of their tasks</li>
        <li>I will be quick to share and encourage, but slow to judge or criticize</li>
        <li>I recognize that deliverables are time bound. My commitments will be made explicitly using <a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria>SMART </a> goals, and I will ask the same from my team members.</li>
        <li>I will, at all times, be honest and forthright in all my dealings. I will not promise anything that I cannot deliver.</li>
        <li>I will escalate issues as early as possible to minimize the impact of my shortfall on my team members who depend on me.</li>
        <li>I understand that T4S is a collaborative community, not a job or contract posting board. I will not spam, or aggressively market to others.</li>
        <li>I will do my part to keep my community strong and vibrant by maintaining current data on my profiles, rating those I work with, and not publishing any profiles that are not ready for the community to engage with.</li>
    </ol>
