    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

    <p>
        Like most website operators, T4S collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. T4S's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how T4S's visitors use its website. From time to time, T4S may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>

    <p>
        T4S also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in and logged out users on T4S.com . T4S only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>

    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

    <p>
        Certain visitors to T4S's websites choose to interact with T4S in ways that require T4S to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that T4S gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for T4S.com to provide their LinkedIn information. Those who engage in transactions with T4S– are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, T4S collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with T4S. T4S does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using T4S's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. T4S will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, T4S discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when T4S believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of T4S, third parties or the public at large.
